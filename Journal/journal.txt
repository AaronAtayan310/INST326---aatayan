Week 1:
This week, I used Claude to help explain a couple concepts found in the week 1 exercise list. These concepts were
related to removing whitespace and specific characters in a string, and how to correctly use the .find() and .rfind() 
functions. I did not use Claude or any other AI to directly complete the week 1 exercises. This is the link to my

I haven't used Claude or any other AI for anything else related to INST326 this week. 

Week 2:
Similar to last week, I used Claude to help clarify and explain some concepts found in week 2's exercises. I asked Claude
to explain to me list searches, for loops, and the sort function. Like last week, I did not use Claude or other AI's to directly complete the week 2 exercises.

Though I did not personally use the AI, our project group used ChatGPT to help come up with more ideas for the project and to help create a more consice charter document. 

Week 3:
This week, I ended up not using AI for anything related to this class. However, I did use Google Chrome to 
search up certain functions and how to do things seen in the the week 3 exercises. 
I also used the module and slides from this week to help me. I did use ChatGPT for a couple other classes to better my understanding of concepts in those said classes (BSST200, INST311)
