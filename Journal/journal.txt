Week 1:
This week, I used Claude to help explain a couple concepts found in the week 1 exercise list. These concepts were
related to removing whitespace and specific characters in a string, and how to correctly use the .find() and .rfind() 
functions. I did not use Claude or any other AI to directly complete the week 1 exercises. This is the link to my

I haven't used Claude or any other AI for anything else related to INST326 this week. 

Week 2:
Similar to last week, I used Claude to help clarify and explain some concepts found in week 2's exercises. I asked Claude
to explain to me list searches, for loops, and the sort function. Like last week, I did not use Claude or other AI's to directly complete the week 2 exercises.

Though I did not personally use the AI, our project group used ChatGPT to help come up with more ideas for the project and to help create a more consice charter document. 

Week 3:
This week, I ended up not using AI for anything related to this class. However, I did use Google Chrome to 
search up certain functions and how to do things seen in the the week 3 exercises. 
I also used the module and slides from this week to help me. I did use ChatGPT for a couple other classes to better my understanding of concepts in those said classes (BSST200, INST311)

Week 4:
This week, I used Claude quite a bit to help explain concepts regarding SQL from Inst327. I also used Claude this week
to explain what the "sorted" function is and does and what the lambda key does as well.

Week 5:
This week I created a project folder in Claude to help with the semester group project. I had Claude generate functions
that would be used in a data pipeline framework with proper documentation according to the Canvas page to get a better
sense of what our project should look like and what it should do.

This week I also had an exam for BSST200 and I used ChatGPT to analyze my own notes so that it could create a 
condensed version of my notes. I also had ChatGPT create a mock exam to help me practice for the real thing

Week 6:
This week, I went back into my project folder in Claude and asked for help on creating some classes. It generated a sample class using some of my functions from the previous project. I am still in the process of creating the classes, but I am using Claude generated class as a foundation to build of off.

I also used ChatGPT to help me study for an exam in BSST334. I uploaded my notes document and asked it to create a study guide for me. I also asked Chat to create a practice exam with question types that would be found in the real exam.

Week 7:
This week, I continued working in the project folder in Claude, specifically with the classes of the group project. I actually didn't use much A.I. this week which I am proud of! Looking to next week though, I will be using an A.I. to help study for an exam I have on Tuesday, November 4th.

Week 8:
This week, I used ChatGPT to help create a study guide and mock exam for my BSST200 Midterm #2. I also used ChatGPT this week to help complete option 3 of this weeks discussion post. I later changed my mind and completed option 2 instead (not using A.I.)
